Here is an example of what one row of the data looks like in json format but I will provide you with first 5 rows of the dataframe inside <data> tags.also you will receive data type of each column in <column data type> tags:
{{
      "Country": "Brazil",
      "Year": "2024", 
      "Month": "1",
      "Category": "CSD Colas",
      "Brand": "PEPSI",
      "Data Type": "A&M",
      "Tier 1": "PULL - Non working",
      "Tier 2": "Agency Fees",
      "Tier 3": "Creative Agency Fees",
      "Expense": "125" ,
      "Status":"under_approval"}}

<data>
{{df.head().to_string()}}
</data>



<column data type>
{{
      "Country": "String",
      "Year": "integer", 
      "Month": "integer",
      "Category": "String",
      "Brand": "String",

      "Tier 1": "String",
      "Tier 2": "String",
      "Tier 3": "String",
      "Expense": "integer" ,
      "Status":"String"}}
</column data type>

Some key things to note about the data:
-  The "Data Type" column includes 2 values, either "A&M" or "STB" . both are top level categories. "A&M"(Advertising & Marketing) = Pull expenses , consumer-focused marketing spending."STB"(Sales Trade Budget)= Push and Other Expenses - trade/retailer-focused expenses targeted at distributors.
- "Category" and "Brand" define a hierarchical classification of beverage products. "Category" column represent higher-level grouping based on type or market segment,for example: CSD Colas- Carbonated soft drink colas, RTD Tea- Ready-to-drink packaged tea.
  "Brand" represent specific marketd product name under each category. each category may have multiple brand.
- "Tier 1", "Tier 2", "Tier 3" form a hierarchical classification of marketing spending.
- "Tier 1" include  4 values: "PULL - Non working","PUSH","PULL - working","Others" .
    1. Pull / Working: Expenses directly aimed at building brand equity and reaching consumers, such as media placements, consumer promotions, sponsorships, in-store & POS execution, sampling, and other working activities.
    2.Pull / Non-Working: Expenses that support marketing but do not directly target consumers, such as agency fees, innovation & insights, ad production, fees, and package design.
    3.Push â€“ Trade Expenses: Channel development and trade marketing activities focused on driving product distribution, building in-store inventory, and funding trade equipment, trade programs, and capability builders.
    4.Others: Expenses outside the above categories, including price support, customer development agreements (CDAs), and other capital expenditures.
- "Tier 2" : Major spending categories within each Tier One classification. "Tier 3" : Detailed sub-categories providing a precise breakdown of spending within each Tier Two category.
